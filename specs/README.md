# DRP Specifications

Distributed Real-Time Programs (DRP) is a local-first protocol for building decentralized real-time applications. DRP enables concurrent state manipulation across distributed nodes without central coordination while maintaining eventual consistency.

## Abstract

This specification defines the core components, behaviors, and algorithms of the DRP protocol:

1. Architecture: Defines the layered structure of DRP including network communication, object synchronization, and application interfaces.

2. Object Model: Describes DRP objects, their state representation, and how they are identified and versioned in a distributed environment.

3. Conflict Resolution: Details the mechanisms for detecting, managing, and resolving concurrent modifications to shared state.

4. Access Control: Outlines the permission model that governs which peers can read from or write to DRP objects.

5. Discovery Mechanism: Documents how nodes discover peers that maintain copies of the same object across the network.
